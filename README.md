### ðŸ‘‹Hey there!

I'm Daniel, a smart contract security researcher from Israel.

 I strongly belive that smart contract based decentralized governance plays a crucial role in shaping an open, transparent, and equitable future. I have self taught myself solidity and am currently deep down the rabbit hole in smart contract security reasearch.
Feel free to explore my repositories. I am always open to collaborations and discussions!
